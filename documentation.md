# Documentation of Progress and Limitations

## Progress Made:
1. **Feature Implementation**:
   - Added checkboxes next to each research paper for user selection.
   - Implemented a "Download Selected Papers" button to facilitate exporting selected papers.

2. **Testing**:
   - Conducted initial tests to verify the presence of checkboxes and the functionality of the export button.
   - Identified that the export functionality currently only allows downloading papers that are stored locally as PDFs.

## Limitations:
1. **PDF Storage**:
   - Selected papers cannot be downloaded as PDFs since they are not stored locally. Users can only download them after viewing the PDF through the provided URLs.
